## Authentication & Admin Handling

### JWT Authentication
- JWT stores `{ username, role }` payload.
- Tokens are stored in `localStorage` for persistent sessions.
- Auto-role detection (Admin/User) post login.

### Admin Credentials
- Stored securely in MongoDB.
- Passwords hashed before saving.
- Admin creation only by existing logged-in admins via dashboard.
